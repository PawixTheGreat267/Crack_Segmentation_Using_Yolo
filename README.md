# Crack Segmentation using YOLOv8seg

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the challenging task of crack segmentation on surfaces. Cracks are a critical indicator of structural integrity issues, and their precise detection and segmentation are essential for automated inspection systems.

To solve this problem, I've leveraged the cutting-edge capabilities of the **YOLOv8seg** model from the Ultralytics framework. YOLOv8seg is a state-of-the-art model for instance segmentation, which not only detects objects but also generates a pixel-perfect segmentation mask for each object instance.

The model was trained on a custom dataset, carefully annotated to outline cracks on various surfaces.

## Training and Results

The YOLOv8seg model was trained for **30 epochs** on a custom crack segmentation dataset. The training process yielded outstanding results, demonstrating the model's ability to learn and accurately segment cracks with a high degree of precision.

### Performance Analysis

The following plots illustrate the model's performance throughout the training process.

#### Key Performance Indicators

- **Loss Reduction**: The training and validation loss curves show a consistent and sharp decrease, indicating that the model was successfully learning and converging towards a robust solution without significant overfitting.
- **High `mAP` Scores**: The Mean Average Precision (mAP) for both bounding boxes and segmentation masks improved dramatically over the 30 epochs.
    - **`mAP50(M)`**: The mAP for segmentation masks at an IoU threshold of 0.5 achieved a very high final value, signifying that the model is highly effective at identifying cracks and producing accurate masks.
    - **`mAP50-95(M)`**: The mAP averaged across stricter IoU thresholds (0.5 to 0.95) also reached an impressive value, which is a strong testament to the model's ability to localize cracks with great precision.

The rapid and significant improvement in both loss and mAP scores confirms that the model is performing exceptionally well on this task, successfully creating a reliable crack segmentation solution.

## Key Metrics Explained

For those new to computer vision and instance segmentation, here is a brief explanation of the key metrics shown in the plots:

- **Loss**: A measure of the model's error. Lower is better.
- **Precision**: Out of all the model's positive predictions, how many were correct?
- **Recall**: Out of all the actual positives, how many did the model correctly identify?
- **mAP**: Mean Average Precision, the industry-standard metric for object detection and segmentation.
    - **`mAP50`**: Evaluates performance using a lenient overlap threshold (IoU=0.5).
    - **`mAP50-95`**: Evaluates performance using a range of stricter overlap thresholds, giving a more complete picture of localization accuracy.
- **(B)**: Metrics related to the predicted **Bounding Boxes**.
- **(M)**: Metrics related to the predicted **Segmentation Masks**.
